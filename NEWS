        https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm-tools/commits/

1.7.0 (XXXX-XX-XX)
 - Improve support for sub-directory structure in Broken Sword 1 (e.g. when the
   files are in the Clusters, Music and Speech sub-directories).
 - Fix issue with output file name in compress_sword2 tool when specifying an
   output directory (the output file name was empty with only an extension).
 - Fix issue when trying to use compress_scumm_san more than once in the GUI
   tool.

1.6.0 (2013-05-31)
 - Fix crash when compiling with wxWidgets 2.9.
 - Add two tools to extract and repackage the Soltys game data.
 - Fix bug #3093138: "compress_tucker with ScummVM CLI Tools not working".
 - Fix bug #3280674: "ScummTools do not compress monster.sou of german fdd-version"
 - Fix various issues on case sensitive systems when looking for input files
   (e.g. in compress_tucker or compress_sword1 the sub-directories and input
   files needed to be all uppercase).
 - Improve tool detection and inputs handling for tools that require multiple
   input files or an input directory (in both the GUI and command line).
 - Add signature to compressed Tinsel .smp to match the one at the start of
   the .idx file. This ensures that no sound starts at offset 0, since that is
   interpreted as the sound missing. This fixes the first line of speech when
   Rincewind wakes up at the beginning of Discworld 1.
 - Fix too long help string for compression tools in the extra input file
   selection which made the file selection impossible because the widgets
   were outside the window.
 - Respect given output directory in compress_tinsel.

1.4.0 (2011-11-11)
 - Updated the compress_sci tool to add support for compressing the AUDIO001.002
   audio files of the CD versions of King's Quest 5 and Jones in the Fast Lane.
   
1.3.0 (2011-05-28)

   Fascination CD image.

 - Change the behavior of the CLI flags for MP3 encoding.
 - Add option to process other files at the end of a process.
 - Improve visual feedback after a process has finished. It should now be clear that
   it has finished and whether it was a success or not.
