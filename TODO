Future Goals
------------

* Default Options
    - Things like default games path, default LAME path, default compression 
      type, etc. could be added to a menu and saved to an *.ini file.
* Enhanced Batch Processing
    - Batch processing now consists of compressing/extracting multiple files
      from the same game.  It can be enhanced holding a list of jobs to done
      from multiple games.  This would involve adding a 'Start Batch' and a 
      'Add to Batch' button and holding a copy of the compressionPanel and
      compressionOptions classes associated with a job.  This would allow for
      the user to modify waiting jobs since we would just replace the current
      compressionPanel and compressionOptions panels with the saved copies.
      The 'Start Batch' button would just iterate through each job, build
      the command line string, and perform the resulting operation.
* Encode DXA Improvements
    - The current implementation of 'Encode DXA' compression only performs the
      final step of the process.  There are already Windows and Unix scripts to
      perform all of the steps in the process.  Another tab could be added to
      the GUI which simply implements the steps found in the DXA scripts.
* Automatic Compression
    - Another tab could be added that would automatically compress an original
      CD.  This would involve identifying the game, either by using filenames
      or md5 hashes, copying all of the files needed to play the game to a
      specified directory, and compressing any applicable files.
