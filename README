	simon2mp3

	compress_san <inputfile>.san <outputfile>.san [<file>.flu>]
		Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It uses lossless
		zlib for compressing FOBJ gfx chunks inside a san file.

		Example of usage:
		compress_san opening.san temp_opening.san 

		'san' filenames which have equivalent 'flu' filenames (which exist 
		in the Full Throttle 'data' dir, ie 'tovista2.san' and 'tovista2.flu')
		must be compressed together, for example: 
		compress_san tovista2.san temp_tovista2.san tovista2.flu
		WARNING: The current status of 'flu' support is not good,
		PLEASE DO NOT COMPRESS this pair of files yet, it will be fixed later.

		The original 'tovista2.san' file is not modified and a new
		'temp_tovista2.san' file is created, but the input file 'tovista2.flu'
		IS MODIFIED while compressing.

		After compression, you must rename
		'temp_tovista2.san' to 'tovista2.san'.

		ScummVM support requires a zlib enabled build.

	convbdf
		Converts BDF (Bitmap Display Format) files to C++ source
