This is a collection of various tools that may be useful to use in conjunction
with ScummVM. Please note that this module is not always in-sync with the latest
STABLE version of ScummVM.

This means that although a tool may support a feature, certain
ScummVM versions may not. ScummVM 0.6.x does not support FLAC audio, for
example.

Extraction Tools:
        kyra_unpak
                Unpacks .PAK files from Kyrandia games.

        rescumm
                Extracts Macintosh "single file" SCUMM games into their
                component parts, for use with ScummVM.
                This is required for ScummVM up to version 0.6.x; all
                later versions directly support reading this file
                format.

        loom_tg16_extract
                Extracts data files from TG16 version of Loom.
                There is currently no support for this game in ScummVM!

        mm_nes_extract
                Extracts data files from NES version of Maniac Mansion.
                There is currently no support for this game in ScummVM!

Compression Tools:
        compress_scumm_sou 
                Used to compress .sou files to .so3 (MP3), .sog (Vorbis),
                or .sof (FLAC).

        queenrebuild
                Used to rebuild the datafile of Flight of the Amazon Queen,
                to allow optional MP3/Ogg/FLAC compression.

        compress_saga
                Compress SAGA engine digital sound files into MP3 and Ogg
                Vorbis format.

        compress_simon
                Compresses Simon voc/wav files to MP3/Ogg/FLAC.

        compress_sword1
                Used to compress Broken Sword 1's music and speech files
                using mp3 or vorbis.

        compress_sword2
                Used to compress Broken Sword 2's music and speech .clu
                files to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC).

                Please note that FLAC-compression will produce a larger file
                than the original! This is because the original files already
                use lossy compression.

        compress_san <inputfile> <inputdir> <outputdir>
                Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It uses lossless
                zlib for compressing FOBJ gfx chunks inside a san file.
                It also can create a separate Ogg file with the audio track.
                There are also temporary files *.tmp and *.wav which could
                be deleted after finished compression.

                Example of usage:
                compress_san opening.san uncomp comp

                In order to use such compressed files, your ScummVM binary 
                must have been built with zlib support enabled (you can find
                out whether that's the case by looking at the About dialog).
                For the Ogg compression feature, your ScummVM binary naturally
                must have been built with Ogg support enabled.

Script Tools:
        descumm
                Decompiles SCUMM scripts

        desword2
                Disassembles Broken Sword II scripts

        dekyra
                Basic script disassembler for Legend of Kyrandia games

Other tools:
        simon1decr
                Used to decrunch the graphics and music files in AGA/ECS 
                versions of Simon the Sorcerer 1 for Amiga
