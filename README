	compress_san <inputfile>.san <outputfile>.san [<file>.flu>]
		Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It use lossless
		zlib for compress FOBJ gfx chunks inside san file.

		Example of usage:
		compress_san opening.san temp_opening.san 

		'San' filenames which have equivalents to 'flu' files (which exist 
		in Full Throttle 'data' dir) 'tovista2.san' and 'tovista2.flu'
		must be compressed together, for example: 
		compress_san tovista2.san temp_tovista2.san tovista2.flu
		WARNING: Current status of 'flu' support is not good,
		PLEASE NOT COMPRESS this pair of files yet, it will be fixed later.

		Original 'tovista2.san' file is not modified and created new
		'temp_tovista2.san' file, but input file 'tovista2.flu' file
		IS MODIFIED while compression.

		After compress of course you must rename
		'temp_tovista2.san' to 'tovista2.san'.

		ScummVM support only with zlib enabled build.
