This is a collection of various tools that may be useful to use in conjunction
with ScummVM. Please note that this module is not always in-sync with the latest
STABLE version of ScummVM.

This means that although a tool may support a feature, certain
ScummVM versions may not. ScummVM 0.6.x does not support FLAC audio, for
example.

                Example of usage:
                extract_parallaction [--small] <file> <outputdir>
                
        extract_scumm_mac
                Extracts Macintosh "single file" SCUMM games into their
                component parts, for use with ScummVM.
                This is required for ScummVM up to version 0.6.x; all
                later versions directly support reading this file
                format.

                Example of usage:
                extract_scumm_mac <file>

        extract_zak_c64
                Extracts data files from the Commodore 64 version of Zak

                Example of usage:
                extract_zak_c64 <disk1.d64> <disk2.d64>

Compression Tools:
        compress_agos
                Used to compress the Feeble Files or Simon 1/2 voc/wav files
                to MP3, Vorbis or FLAC.

                Example of usage:
                compress_agos [params] <file | mac> 

        compress_kyra
                Used to compress The Legend of Kyrandia's speech files with
                MP3, Vorbis or FLAC.

                Example of usage:
                compress_kyra <flags here> input/GEMCUT.VRM output/GEMCUT.VRM

                Note: You have to keep the VRM extension, else it will NOT work.
                Use it like shown above, copy all *.VRM files to a directory
                and let the tool put the output file in another directory.

        compress_queen
                Used to rebuild the datafile of Flight of the Amazon Queen,
                and allow optional MP3, Vorbis or FLAC compression.

                Example of usage:
                compress_queen [params] queen.1

        compress_saga
                Used to compress SAGA engine digital sound files to MP3, Vorbis
                or FLAC. 

                Example of usage:
                compress_saga <flags here> <file>

                Where <file> is the sound file you with to compress, without the
                extension.

                For Inherit the Earth, the digital music (music.rsc), speech 
                (voices.rsc or "inherit the earth voices") and sound effects
                (sounds.rsc) files can be compressed. For I have no mouth, the 
                speech (voices*.res) files can be compressed.
		
                The compressed files have the ".cmp" extension. Once compressed, 
                you only need the respective .cmp files. 
		
                There is no compression support yet for the following versions:
                - The Mac CD Guild version of Inherit the Earth (uses MacBinary
                  *.bin files)
                - The unsupported early DOS demo of Inherit the Earth

        compress_scumm_bun <inputfile> <inputdir> <outputdir> [params]
                Used to the compress '.bun' music/voice files with MP3, Vorbis
                or FLAC.

                Example of usage:
                compress_scumm.bun digmusic.bun uncomp comp --flac

                Please note that FLAC compression will produce larger files
                than the original, for The Curse of Monkey Island!

        compress_scumm_san <inputfile> <inputdir> <outputdir> [--ogg]
                Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It uses lossless
                zlib for compressing FOBJ gfx chunks inside a san file.
                It also can create a separate Ogg file with the audio track.

                Example of usage:
                compress_scumm_san opening.san uncomp comp

                In order to use such compressed files, your ScummVM binary
                must have been built with zlib support enabled (you can find
                out whether that's the case by looking at the About dialog).
                For the Ogg or MP3 compression feature, your ScummVM binary
                naturally must have been built with Ogg or MP3 support enabled.

                NOTE: For some '.san' files there is a corresponding '.flu'
                file, which contains offsets into the '.san' file. Hence, the
                compress_scumm_san has to modify the '.flu' file. This happens
                automatically, if the '.san' and '.flu' files are in the
                same directory (which is normally the case). If you want to
                move the '.san' files before compressing them, make sure to
                move the '.flu' files, too!

        compress_scumm_sou
                Used to compress .sou files to .so3 (MP3), .sog (Vorbis),
                or .sof (FLAC).

                Example of usage:
                compress_scumm_sou [params] monster.sou

        compress_sword1
                Used to compress Broken Sword 1's music and speech .clu
                files to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC).

                Example of usage:
                compress_sword1 [params] <inputdir>

       compress_sword2
                Used to compress Broken Sword 2's music and speech .clu
                files to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC).

                Please note that FLAC compression will produce a larger file
                than the original! This is because the original files already
                use lossy compression.

                Example of usage:
                compress_sword2 [params] <file>

        compress_touche
                Used to compress and pack Touche speech files ('Vxxx' and
                'OBJ') to MP3, Vorbis or FLAC to a single file named
                TOUCHE.SO3 (MP3), TOUCHE.SOG (Vorbis), or TOUCHE.SOF (FLAC).

                Once compressed, only TOUCHE.DAT and TOUCHE.SOx files are
                required to play the game under ScummVM.

                Example of usage:
                compress_touche [params] <inputdir> <outputdir>

Script Tools:
        descumm
                Decompiles SCUMM scripts

        desword2
                Disassembles Broken Sword II scripts

        dekyra
                Basic script disassembler for Legend of Kyrandia games

Encoder Tools:
        encode_dxa <filename>

                Creates DXA file out of extracted Smacker video.

                To extract a video use RAD Game Tools and perform 2 passes
                on it. For example, if your video is called 'intro.smk'.

                1. Extract the video to PNG, 256 colors (choose PNG format
                and tick the checkbox). It will create bunch of files named
                'introXXX.png', where XXX is frame number. Make sure you have
                extracted 256 colors PNGs, otherwise encode_dxa will complain.

                2. Extract the audio to WAV format, you will get an
                'intro.wav' file.

                3. Put files 'intro.smk', 'intro.wav' and 'intro*.png' into a
                single directory.

                4. Run `encode_dxa intro.smk` in that directory

                5. You will get an intro.dxa file and intro.flac/mp3/ogg file
                in result.

                Additionally you may use batch processing mode of SMK files in
                RAD Game Tools. Just select more than one file and push the
                'Convert' button. It will ask you either you want them
                processed in batch mode and will do this for you. All buttons
                and conversion options work the same.

        convert_dxa.bat
        convert_dxa_one.bat

                To ease your life we also provide batch files to autoconvert
                all files. It should work with any game version.

                1. Copy *.smk files from all CDs to some directory

                2. Edit paths in convert_dxa.bat file.

                3. Run the batch. If you set everything correct, it will be
                almost unattended conversion, just for several files there
                are no audio, and RAD Game Tools converter will ask you to
                press OK

        convert_dxa.sh

                Same as above convert_dxa.bat, just for *nix-based systems.
                It uses Wine to run RAD Game Tools.
