This is a collection of various tools that may be useful to use in conjunction
with ScummVM.

Extraction Tools:
        rescumm: 
                 Extracts Macintosh "single file" SCUMM games into their
                 component parts, for use with ScummVM.

        loom_tg16_extract: 
                Extracts data files from TG16 version of Loom
                There is currently no support for this game in ScummVM!

        mm_nes_extract
                Extracts data files from NES version of Maniac Mansion
                There is currently no support for this game in ScummVM!

Compression Tools:
        extract 
                Used to compress .sou files to .so3 (MP3), .sog (Vorbis),
                or .sof (FLAC)

        queenrebuild
                Used to rebuild the datafile of Flight of the Amazon Queen,
                to allow optional MP3/Ogg/FLAC compression.

        simon2mp3
                Compresses Simon voc/wav files to MP3/Ogg/FLAC.

        sword2mp3
                Used to compress Broken Sword 2's music and speech .clu
                files to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC).

                Please note that FLAC-compression will produce a larger file
                than the original! This is because the original files already
                use lossy compression.

                Also note that Broken Sword 1 appears to use a completely
                different compression for its speech .clu files. This program
                will NOT work on them.

        compress_san <inputfile>.san <outputfile>.san [<file>.flu>]
                Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It uses lossless zlib
                for compressing FOBJ gfx chunks inside a san file.

                Example of usage:
                compress_san opening.san temp_opening.san 

                'san' filenames which have equivalent 'flu' filenames (which exist 
                in the Full Throttle 'data' dir, ie 'tovista2.san' and 'tovista2.flu')
                must be compressed together, for example: 
                compress_san tovista2.san temp_tovista2.san tovista2.flu
                WARNING: The current status of 'flu' support is not good,
                PLEASE DO NOT COMPRESS this pair of files yet, it will be fixed later.

                The original 'tovista2.san' file is not modified and a new
                'temp_tovista2.san' file is created, but the input file 'tovista2.flu'
                IS MODIFIED while compressing.

                After compression, you must rename
                'temp_tovista2.san' to 'tovista2.san'.

                ScummVM support requires a zlib enabled build.

Script Tools:
        descumm
                Decompiles SCUMM scripts

        desword2
                Disassembles Broken Sword II scripts
