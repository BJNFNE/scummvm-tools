This is a collection of various tools that may be useful to use in conjunction
with ScummVM. Please note that this module is not always in-sync with the latest
STABLE version of ScummVM.

This means that although a tool may support a feature, certain
ScummVM versions may not. ScummVM 0.6.x does not support FLAC audio, for
example.

Extraction Tools:
        extract_kyra
                Unpacks .PAK files from Kyrandia games.

        extract_scumm_mac
                Extracts Macintosh "single file" SCUMM games into their
                component parts, for use with ScummVM.
                This is required for ScummVM up to version 0.6.x; all
                later versions directly support reading this file
                format.

        extract_loom_tg16
                Extracts data files from TG16 version of Loom.
                There is currently no support for this game in ScummVM!

        extract_mm_nes
                Extracts data files from NES version of Maniac Mansion.

        extract_simon1_amiga
                Extracts the graphics or music files in AGA/ECS
                versions of Simon the Sorcerer 1 for Amiga

Compression Tools:
        compress_scumm_sou 
                Used to compress .sou files to .so3 (MP3), .sog (Vorbis),
                or .sof (FLAC).

        compress_queen
                Used to rebuild the datafile of Flight of the Amazon Queen,
                to allow optional MP3/Ogg/FLAC compression.

        compress_saga
                Compress SAGA engine digital sound files into MP3 and Ogg
                Vorbis format.

        compress_simon
                Compresses Simon voc/wav files to MP3/Ogg/FLAC.

        compress_sword1
                Used to compress Broken Sword 1's music and speech files
                using mp3 or vorbis.

        compress_sword2
                Used to compress Broken Sword 2's music and speech .clu
                files to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC).

                Please note that FLAC-compression will produce a larger file
                than the original! This is because the original files already
                use lossy compression.

        compress_san <inputfile> <inputdir> <outputdir> [--ogg]
                Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It uses lossless
                zlib for compressing FOBJ gfx chunks inside a san file.
                It also can create a separate Ogg file with the audio track.

                Example of usage:
                compress_san opening.san uncomp comp

                In order to use such compressed files, your ScummVM binary 
                must have been built with zlib support enabled (you can find
                out whether that's the case by looking at the About dialog).
                For the Ogg or Mad compression feature, your ScummVM binary
                naturally must have been built with Ogg or Mad support enabled.

        compress_scumm_bun <inputfile> <inputdir> <outputdir> [--ogg]

                Compresses '.bun' music/voice files.

                Example of usage:
                compress_scumm.bun digmusic.bun uncomp comp

                For the Ogg or Mad compression feature, your ScummVM binary
                naturally must have been built with Ogg or Mad support enabled.

Script Tools:
        descumm
                Decompiles SCUMM scripts

        desword2
                Disassembles Broken Sword II scripts

        dekyra
                Basic script disassembler for Legend of Kyrandia games
