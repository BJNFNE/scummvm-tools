This is a collection of various tools that may be useful to use in conjunction
with ScummVM.

Extraction Tools:
        rescumm: 
                 Extracts Macintosh "single file" SCUMM games into their
                 component parts, for use with ScummVM.

        loom_tg16_extract: 
                Extracts data files from TG16 version of Loom
                There is currently no support for this game in ScummVM!

        mm_nes_extract
                Extracts data files from NES version of Maniac Mansion
                There is currently no support for this game in ScummVM!

Compression Tools:
        extract 
                Used to compress .sou files to .so3 (MP3), .sog (Vorbis),
                or .sof (FLAC)

        queenrebuild
                Used to rebuild the datafile of Flight of the Amazon Queen,
                to allow optional MP3/Ogg/FLAC compression.

        simon2mp3
                Compresses Simon voc/wav files to MP3/Ogg/FLAC.

        sword2mp3
                Used to compress Broken Sword 2's music and speech .clu
                files to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC).

                Please note that FLAC-compression will produce a larger file
                than the original! This is because the original files already
                use lossy compression.

                Also note that Broken Sword 1 appears to use a completely
                different compression for its speech .clu files. This program
                will NOT work on them.

        compress_san <inputfile> <inputdir> <outputdir>
                Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It uses lossless zlib
                for compressing FOBJ gfx chunks inside a san file.
                It also can create ogg separate file with smush audio track
                (only COMI currently supported).

                Example of usage:
                compress_san opening.san uncomp comp

                WARNING: The current status of 'flu' support is not good,
                PLEASE DO NOT COMPRESS this pair of files yet, it will be fixed
                later.

                ScummVM support requires a zlib enabled build, and Ogg support
                for ogg audio track playback.
